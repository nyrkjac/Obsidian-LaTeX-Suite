# Obsidian-LaTeX-Suite

This is my custom settings for the Obsidian plugin "LaTeX-Suite". Simply copy the text inside the .js file and paste in into the snippets section in the plugins settings within Obsidian's app settings. This data is usually stored in the data.json file but since Github had some issues with uploading this file, I chose to make it available as a .js file with the added benefit of neat syntax highlighting.
